\cvItemListStart
\cvItem{A decentralized edge computer vision solution, TrafficEZ, innovates smart traffic management by approximating traffic density using a two-phase approach: object detection and tracking during the green-light phase and YOLO during the red-light phase. Designed for edge computing, it ensures real-time performance and independence at each smart traffic junction at a low cost, while a Wireless Sensor Network integrates neighboring junction states for cohesive traffic flow optimization.}

{\textbf{{Shared Gaze Training}} $|$ \emph{\href{https://github.com/sid410/Gaze-Sharing-Demo-Hololens2}{GitHub}{ $|$ }\href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/t4wewv2h5x99ltd/TPP\%20AR\%20Eyegaze.mp4?dl=0}{Demo Video}}} {\Csharp{} $|$ Unity $|$ Vuforia $|$ HoloLens 2}

\cvItemListStart
\cvItem{An AR project aimed at enhancing surgical training through observation of nonverbal information and instruction. Utilizing a piano-playing scenario for its parallels to surgical operations, the system employs shared gaze visualization to foster mutual gaze awareness with minimal mental effort. By presenting novices with an expert's gaze information in real-time, complemented by heat map visualizations, it creates opportunities for insights and fosters skill acquisition, showcasing the potential of AR in complex skill training.}
